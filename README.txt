Compile:
	To compile the program run "make"

Run:
	Before running the program, create an input file called "input.txt" and put the set of Points of which you want to find out the Convex Hull and Save the file
	Ex. input.txt file content:
		1 1
		2 0
		2 2
		1 2
		0 0
		0 2
		2 4
		4 1
		3 3
		4 4
	To run the program, compile the program first and then run "./submission input.txt".

Output:

	Convex Hull Points are:
	(0, 2)
	(2, 4)
	(4, 4)
	(4, 1)
	(2, 0)
	(0, 0)
